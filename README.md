A spinoff of "Sorry", made using C++ and SFML library.

My HS Senior year Semester Project for Intro to C++ course.

To play(this is scuffed as heck):

Move the .exe from  Intro-to-C--Semester-Project--Game-of-Sorry-But-cooler--main\x64\Debug\C++SemesterProjectSorry.exe

To       Intro-to-C--Semester-Project--Game-of-Sorry-But-cooler--main\C++SemesterProjectSorry

And run .exe
